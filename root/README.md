A complete Online Learning System for the CSEN704 Course (Advanced Programming Lab) in GUC (German University in Cairo). An Online Health Clinic System as a web application through which clinical services are exchanged.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from a deep commitment to enhancing healthcare accessibility. By creating a centralized platform, the goal is to make healthcare services readily available to a wider audience, ensuring patients can easily connect with pharmacists and access vital medicalÂ information.
with this project being a requirement for our ACL course in the GUC it was able to help us understand and implement the MERN Stack, and think critically about implementing a functioning website which nudges into our future career paths.

## Objectives
- Learn how to properly use the Agile Methodology to plan out a project and develop the software.
- Learn the process of following a given set of system requirements to develop a software.
- Learn to research and master the use of the MERN Stack.
- Learn how to work together as a team on GitHub.
- Work under project manager and do feedback sessions to make more improvements.
  
## Tech/Framework used
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- JavaScript
